This Python script is an example that solves a mathematical optimization problem using the Quassi Newton algorithm. The code is designed to find the minimum of a two-variable function. The steps involved are as follows:

Defining Symbolic Variables:
The symbolic variables x_1, x_2, S, α, β, and ϴ are defined.

Determining the Function:
A function of two variables is determined as f(x_1, x_2) = x_1^2 + 3x_2^2 + x_1x_2 + x_1 + x_2, f.

Calculation of Derivatives:
The derivatives of the function with respect to x_1 and x_2 are calculated.

Starting Point and Hessian Matrix:
The starting point X_0 and the Hessian matrix h_0 are determined.

Gradient and First Iteration:
At the starting point, the gradient (q_0) and search direction (p_0) of the function are calculated. In the first iteration, the new location X_1 is found.

Second Iteration and β Calculation:
The dot product of the gradient (q_1) and its transpose at the new location and the search direction transpose is calculated. This result gives the value β.

Finding S and Calculating the New Position:
S value is found by using the search direction and β value in the first iteration. The new position (real_X_1) is calculated with this S value.

Printing Results:
β is used to print calculated values.

This script contains the basic steps of the Quassi Newton algorithm for solving a numerical optimization problem.
